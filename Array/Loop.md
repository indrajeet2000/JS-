<inst>For of loop</inst><br> 
for (const i of arr) - arr is data type containing elements and i is individual element
 
Using entries - for( const [i, elements] of arr.entries())
 
 
For each loop 
arr.forEach(function (i){});
It's callback function
 
Using entries - arr.foreach(function (curr_element,i,arr){});
Only drawback of using for each loop is we can't use break or continue
 
 
For each - maps and sets

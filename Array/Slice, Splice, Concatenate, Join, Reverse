**Arr.slice(from,to)**
don't mutate, parameters given to show from to elements, it resturns copy of array
here 'to' is not included, to is external parameter
It's similar to rest operator
The only usecase of slice over spread is when we have to call it multiple times
 
Arr.splice(from,to: number of elements we want to delete) - mutate, parameters given which should be eliminated
In console.log - splice will return which elements are being eliminated
In orginal array it'll remove the elements
 
-1 last 1 element
-2 last 2 elements
1,2
 
Arr.Reverse :  mutate and reverse the array
 
Arr.concat(arr2) : concatenate in arr mutate
 
Arr.join('-') :  add - in between
